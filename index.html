      <h2>A visualization of Meteorite Landings</h2>
      <p>Collision is a data visualization project based on the data of all of the known meteorite landings. <br>
        The project explores these records with two visualizations, analyzing the number of collisions and each meteorites’s mass and composition.
      <br>
        The data is provided by The Meteoritical Society and distributed through NASA’s Open Data Portal. Its information is updated to 2013.</p>
      <h2>Number x date</h2>
      <p class="caption">This bar chart visualizes the number of landings for each year between 1950 and 2013, when the recordings were more likely to be accurate. A growth in the number of collected data is however noticeable up to the 70s.
        <br>
        The year 2013 shows partial information, since it was still being collected at the time of release.
      <br><br>
      On user interaction, for each year are displayed the total number of landings and the six heaviest meteorites, with their id.

      <h2>Mass x composition</h2>
      <p class="caption">
        The following bubble chart explores the link between average mass and meteorite composition.
        <br>
        Meteorites can be divided into four groups according to their composition:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stony (Chondrites and Achondrites, Lunar and Martian meteorites);</li>
        <li>Stony-iron (Pallasites and Mesosiderites);</li>
        <li>Iron (Magmatic and Non-magmatic).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="caption">
        Relict meteorites are instead thise whose material has been heavily altered by the fall.
        <br>
        The graph enlights how Stony meteorites tend to have a significntly higher mass, on average.
